Thank you for the opportunity to try this coding exercise for Saylent. I learned a lot!
I used swagger-codegen to generate code from the swagger.yaml. Any files that I altered, I made a note of it in the source code. Source code and war are included in the upload.

To run the example:
Deploy SaylentExercise.war to your favorite web server (I use Tomcat)
Start the server
1) to call the web service for the users, use http://localhost:8080/SaylentExercise/rest/users
2) to call the web service for the posts, use http://localhost:8080/SaylentExercise/rest/posts
3) to call the web service for the comments, use http://localhost:8080/SaylentExercise/rest/comments
4) to see the web page with list of users, post title and counts, use http://localhost:8080/SaylentExercise/DisplayPosts
